<p>Hi my name is Zac Garland!</p>
<p>I’m a self taught developer impassioned about investing &amp; data science.</p>
<p>Professionally, I’m an associate engineer @ Mastercard’s economics institute. my work is focused on data science &amp; web development.
lately i’ve been working on a macroeconomic recession model &amp; an html business proposal for the c-suite. previously, I was a consultant at FactSet
where I worked with institutional asset managers on their quant workflows.</p>
<p>Outside of work, I’m a mountain man. I live in Breckenridge, colorado. you can find me with my pup (winston) in the woods, knee deep in a river, up a mountain, or walking around town.</p>
<p>learn more about my coding journey <a>here</a>.</p>
<p>feel free to <a>contact me</a> about equity research, data science, or future opportunities.</p>
