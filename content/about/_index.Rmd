Hi my name is Zac Garland! 

I'm a self taught developer impassioned about investing & data science.  

Professionally, I'm an associate engineer @ Mastercard's economics institute. my work is focused on data science & web development.
lately i've been working on a macroeconomic recession model & an html business proposal for the c-suite. previously, I was a consultant at FactSet
where I worked with institutional asset managers on their quant workflows.  

Outside of work, I'm a mountain man. I live in Breckenridge, colorado. you can find me with my pup (winston) in the woods, knee deep in a river, up a mountain, or walking around town.

learn more about my coding journey <a>here</a>.

feel free to <a>contact me</a> about equity research, data science, or future opportunities.
