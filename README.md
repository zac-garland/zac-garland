this is a repo to host the source files of my personal website
[](zacgarland.com)

which contains blog posts regarding data science, investing, and coding in R. 

The website is built via the R package [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown). Please read its documentation for how to use it. 

The theme is based on the [Hugo Future Imperfect theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/future-imperfect/) which was modified to fit my personal style.
